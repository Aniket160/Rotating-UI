                Rajneesh (born Chandra Mohan Jain, 11 December 1931 – 19 January 1990), also known as Acharya Rajneesh,[2] Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh, and later as Osho (/ˈoʊʃoʊ/), was an Indian godman, mystic, and founder of the Rajneesh movement.During his lifetime, he was viewed as a controversial new religious movement leader and a mystic Guru. He rejected institutional religions. Rajneesh emphasised the importance of freethought, meditation, mindfulness, love, celebration, courage, creativity, and humour—qualities that he viewed as being suppressed by adherence to static belief systems, religious dogmas and traditions, and socialization.

                In the 1960s, Rajneesh travelled throughout India as a public speaker and became known as a vocal critic of mainstream political ideologies and of Mahatma Gandhi,as well as the orthodoxy of mainstream religions.In 1970, Rajneesh spent time in Mumbai initiating followers known as "neo-sannyasins".During this period, he expanded his spiritual teachings and commented extensively in discourses on the writings of religious traditions, mystics, bhakti poets, and philosophers from around the world. In 1974, Rajneesh relocated to Pune, where an ashram was established and a variety of therapies, incorporating methods first developed by the Human Potential Movement, were offered to a growing Western following.By the late 1970s, the tension between the ruling Janata Party government of Morarji Desai and the movement led to a curbing of the ashram's development and a back tax claim estimated at $5 million
